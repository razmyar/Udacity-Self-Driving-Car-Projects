# **Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Course Projects** 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview 
This repository contains all the Udacity CarND projects. Please note that the required datasets for running the notebook projects are not included in that this repo. However, you should be able to find them on [Udacity GitHub](https://github.com/udacity).

#### Getting Started
To setup, follow the instruction in [ CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit). Once completed, to start Jupyter in your browser, use terminal to navigate to the project directory and then run ``jupyter notebook  ``.

## Project 01 - Basic Lane Detection
<img src="./prj01 - Basic Lane Detection/examples/laneLines_thirdPass.jpg" width="480" alt="Combined Image" />



When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm. In this project, **Python OpenCV** is used to identify lane lines on the road.

## Project 02 - Deep Learning Traffic Sign Classifier
<img src="./prj02 - Traffic Signs Classification/img/sign.jpeg" width="480" alt="Combined Image" />

Traffic signs are an integral part of our transportation system. They provide critical information for drivers to promote their safety. Establishing a reliable traffic signs Classification mechanism is a significant step towards building semi-autonomous/autonomous vehicles.  In this project, ** Google's TensorFlow ** is used to implement a deep convolutional neural network to classify the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

## **Project 03 - Behaviorial Cloning**
<img src="prj03 - Behavioral Cloning/img/simulator.jpg" width="480" alt="Combined Image" />

The object of this project is to apply deep learning techniques to teach a car to drive autonomously in a simulated driving application. **Keras** framework is used to implement a deep convolutional network.
